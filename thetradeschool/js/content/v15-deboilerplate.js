   TradeSchool V15 — boilerplate stripper
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The V7-V10 content passes filled every concept's schema to 100%, which looks
   complete in a validator and reads as filler on the page. Measured across the
   428 concepts before this pass:

       safety         one identical sentence on 104 concepts
       verify         one identical 3-line block on  76 concepts
       misconceptions one identical block on         73 concepts
       analogy        one identical sentence on      60 concepts
       recognize      one identical block on         14 concepts

   A sentence that is true of 104 different things teaches nothing about any of
   them. Rather than hard-coding regexes for the strings we happen to know about,
   this pass counts every string in every list field and removes any that recur
   across more concepts than THRESHOLD. New boilerplate introduced later gets
   caught automatically.

   Concepts touched by v15-currency.js keep their specific lines, because those
   were written for one concept each and will never cross the threshold.

     Knowledge checks.

     Measured before this pass: 416 of the 428 checks shared just three option
     sets. 96 concepts asked literally "What best shows you understand <title>?"
     with the same four answers. That is not assessment, it is a shape that looks
     like assessment, and answering it correctly proves nothing about the topic.

     Same rule as the prose: if the same options are attached to more than
     THRESHOLD concepts, the check is generic and gets removed. What survives is
     the small number of checks that were actually written about their concept.
