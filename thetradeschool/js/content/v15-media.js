   TradeSchool V15 — media integrity layer
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Runs after every other content file, so it has the last word on visualAssets.

   Two jobs:
     1. PURGE — remove every mapping that points at a file deleted in the V15
        media audit. Those photos did not show the thing they claimed to show.
     2. REPLACE — install original technical diagrams built by
        tools/media/build_diagrams.py, plus honest re-labels for photos that
        were real but mis-captioned.

   Rule kept from docs/MEDIA_POLICY.md: a visual earns its place by teaching
   recognition or mechanism. If neither a correct photo nor a correct diagram
   exists for a concept, the concept gets no image at all.
